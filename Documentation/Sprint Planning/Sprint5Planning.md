# Sprint 5 Planning

## Sprint Details
- **Sprint Number**: 5  
- **Sprint Duration**: 1 Week  
- **Sprint Goal**: Finalize testing and documentation, and complete CI/CD pipeline updates in preparation for production deployment.

## Sprint Objectives

1. **Testing Finalization**
   - Complete remaining **unit tests** across all microservices.
   - Finalize **integration tests**, especially for service routes with test databases.
   - Ensure **end-to-end (E2E)** tests simulate realistic user scenarios and run successfully within a containerized environment.
   - Aim for high test coverage and confidence in system stability.

2. **Documentation & UML**
   - Create and include **UML Use Case Diagrams** for all major actors and system functionalities.
   - Update **existing UML diagrams** .

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements**
   - Expand existing GitHub Actions workflows to:
     - Include test reports and coverage summaries.
     - Run E2E tests using containerized services.
     - Deploy artifacts or preview builds if applicable.
   - Validate pipeline reliability and repeatability across test environments.

## Notes
- This sprint focuses on **quality assurance** and **deployment readiness**.
- All services and components of the Admin should be considered **feature-complete** by the end of the sprint (with only small frontend design improvements and maybe backend stability imporvements to be expected in the future).
