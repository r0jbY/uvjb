# Sprint 1 Planning

## Sprint Details
- **Sprint Number**: 1
- **Sprint Duration**: 1 Week
- **Sprint Goal**: Establish project foundations by setting up a structure for the project repository, creating a SCRUM board and a project charter.
  In addition, begin the transition from a monolithical Java Spring Boot backend to a microservices architecture using Express.js.

## Sprint Objectives
1. **Create Project Charter**
2. **Document Use Cases**
   - Identify core functionalities.
   - Define actors and their interactions with the system.
   - Create UML use case diagrams.
3. **Rework Backend Architecture**
   - Analyze current Java Spring Boot monolith structure.
   - Design initial microservices architecture.
   - Set up Express.js environment and create the first microservice.

## Sprint 1 Review

### Completed Items
- **Project Charter**: Successfully created and finalized.
- **Use Case Documentation**: All user roles and their use cases have been clearly identified and described.
- **Backend Architecture Rework**:
  - Designed the initial microservices architecture.
  - Set up the Express.js environment.
  - Created the first microservice: the **Authentication Service** (currently in progress).

### Partially Completed
- **Use Case Documentations**: List of users and use cases has been documented, but UML diagrams are still pending and will be carried into the next sprints.
- **Authentication Service**: The service was created, but it is not yet fully implemented and tested.

### Notes
- Transitioning from the monolithic Spring Boot application to a microservices-based structure in Express.js has begun successfully, with a solid foundation laid during this sprint.
- The remaining tasks (UML diagrams and finalizing the auth service) will be prioritized in Sprint 2.
