# Sprint 2 Planning

## Sprint Details
- **Sprint Number**: 2
- **Sprint Duration**: 2 Weeks
- **Sprint Goal**: Finalize and stabilize the authentication microservice with tests and CI integration, and begin implementation of the first full use case: user login for both Admins and Buddies, which means also creating the Mobile App and Admin Dashboard
  frontends. Afterwards, continue fully implementing more use cases.

## Sprint Objectives
1. **Finalize Authentication Microservice**
   - Complete core implementation.
   - Add unit and integration tests.

2. **Set Up CI Pipeline**
   - Create CI pipeline using GitHub Actions (or preferred tool).

3. **Implement Login Use Case**
   - Design and document the login flow for Admins and Buddies.
   - Handle session/token creation and response formatting.
   - Include validation and appropriate error messages.

4. **Create Use Case Diagram**
   - Create a UML use case diagram for the documented use cases

## Notes
- Sprint 2 will emphasize both code quality and DevOps practices by adding automated testing and CI early on.
- Starting with a complete, production-ready login use case sets the standard for future features.
- If login use case if fully implemented and documented, start working on another use case.

- ## Sprint 2 Review

### Completed Items
- **Authentication Microservice**: Core implementation was completed. Unit and integration tests were added, ensuring the service meets initial reliability and security standards.
- **CI Pipeline**: Successfully set up using GitHub Actions. Automated tests, as well as static code analysis with SonarQube, now run on each push and pull request, establishing a DevOps baseline.
- **Login Use Case (Admin Dashboard)**: Fully implemented and tested for the Admin Dashboard. The authentication flow—including session handling, token generation, validation, and error management—is complete and stable.


### Not Completed
- **Login Use Case (Mobile App)**: Implementation for the Mobile will start at a later stage.
- **Additional Use Case Implementation**: Work on other use cases did not begin due to the extended scope of Sprint 2 and academic deadlines.
- **UML Use Case Diagram**: A use case diagram was not yet created for the identified functionalities.

### Notes
- The sprint was extended to **3 weeks** instead of the planned 2 weeks to accommodate preparation for a university **midterm report and presentation**.
