# Sprint 3 Planning

## Sprint Details
- **Sprint Number**: 3
- **Sprint Duration**: 2 Weeks
- **Sprint Goal**: Implement core admin functionalities related to managing clients and users. This includes building all related backend and frontend components, as well as completing the corresponding analysis and design documentation.

## Sprint Objectives

1. **Implement Admin Use Cases**
   - **See an overview of all client profiles**
   - **See an overview of all user profiles**
   - **Register a new client**
   - **Register a new user**
   - **Delete users**
   - **Edit users**
   - **Edit clients**

2. **Create Supporting Documentation**
   - Create a **UML Use Case Diagram** for the new admin functionalities.
   - Provide **Analysis Artifacts**:
   - Create **Design Artifacts**:
     - Updated Software Architecture Diagram
     - Database schemas for microservices
     - UI mockups or wireframes (optional but recommended).

## Notes
- This sprint builds on the authentication and login work completed in the previous sprints.
- Development will span both backend (microservices) and frontend (Admin Dashboard).
- Testing and validation will be done alongside implementation to ensure stable feature delivery.

## Sprint 3 Review

### Completed Items
- **Admin Functionalities**: All core admin use cases (view, register, edit, delete clients and users) were fully implemented in both the backend microservices and the frontend Admin Dashboard.
- **Documentation**: Key design and analysis artifacts were completed, including:
  - Updated Software Architecture Diagram
  - Database schemas for relevant microservices
  - UI mockups to guide the admin dashboard features

### Not Completed
- **UML Use Case Diagram**: The use case diagram for the new admin functionalities was not completed.
- **Testing**: Full testing coverage for new features (unit, integration, and E2E) has not yet been achieved and will continue in the next sprint.
