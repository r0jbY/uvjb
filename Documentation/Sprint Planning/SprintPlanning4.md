# Sprint 4 Planning

## Sprint Details
- **Sprint Number**: 4  
- **Sprint Duration**: 2 Weeks  
- **Sprint Goal**: Finalize the implementation of the Admin Dashboard, implement the client network management features, ensure full test coverage, and prepare the system for deployment, including updates to the CI pipeline.

## Sprint Objectives

1. **Implement Client Network Management**
   - Design and implement backend functionality to manage client networks.
   - Build corresponding frontend components in the Admin Dashboard.

2. **Finalize Admin Dashboard**
   - Complete any remaining UI and UX refinements.
   - Connect and validate all admin features end-to-end.

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Write and complete unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests.
   - Validate backend and frontend features using automated and manual testing.
   - Use realistic test data to simulate production-like scenarios.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements**
   - Update GitHub Actions workflows to include:
     - Frontend build and test steps
     - Linting and formatting checks
     - E2E testing in containers (if applicable)
   - Ensure all services are integrated into the CI pipeline.

5. **Deployment Readiness**
   - Prepare deployment configuration (Docker, .env, secrets handling).

## Notes
- This sprint builds on the completed admin functionalities and authentication system.
- A successful outcome means the system is **feature-complete**, **well-tested**, and **ready for deployment**.

- # Sprint 4 Review

## Completed Items

- **Admin Dashboard**: Full implementation of all admin dashboard features has been achieved.

- **Client Network Management**: The complete functionality for managing client-buddy relationships (add/remove at multiple layers) was implemented.

- **Backend Microservices**: All backend services have been containerized using Docker and are consistently running through `docker-compose`.

## Not Completed

- **Testing Coverage**: While significant progress has been made, complete unit, integration, and E2E test coverage has not yet been finalized. This will continue in Sprint 5.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Initial version of the CI pipeline still has to be updated.

- **Production Deployment Setup**: Secrets management, production database setup, and full deployment orchestration (e.g., with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm) remain in progress and will be addressed next.
